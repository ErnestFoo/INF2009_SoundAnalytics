**Sound Analytics with Raspberry Pi 4 using Microphone**

**Objective:** By the end of this session, participants will understand how to set up a microphone with the Raspberry Pi 4, capture audio, and conduct basic sound analytics.

---

**Prerequisites:**
1. Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspbian OS installed.
2. MicroSD card (16GB or more recommended).
3. USB keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
4. USB microphone compatible with Raspberry Pi.
5. Internet connectivity (Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
6. Basic knowledge of Python and Linux commands.

---

**1. Introduction (10 minutes)**
- Overview of sound analytics and its significance.
- Applications of sound processing with Raspberry Pi.

**2. Setting up the Raspberry Pi (10 minutes)**
- Booting up the Raspberry Pi.
- Setting up Wi-Fi/Ethernet.
- System updates:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

**3. Connecting and Testing the Microphone (15 minutes)**
- Physically connecting the microphone to the Raspberry Pi.
- Testing the microphone:
  ```bash
  arecord --duration=10 test.wav
  aplay test.wav
  ```

**4. Introduction to Sound Processing with Python (20 minutes)**
- Installing necessary Python libraries (may need additional libraries if not preinstalled with default python):
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libportaudio0 libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 portaudio19-dev
  sudo pip3 install pyaudio
  ```
  ```bash
  sudo pip3 install scipy matplotlib
  ```
- Capturing audio in Python.
- Fourier Transform: Understanding frequency components of sound.
- Visualizing sound waves (both the wave itself and the audio spectrum).
  ```
  For above tasks, you can use the sample file *'microphone_streaming_with_spectrum.py'*
  ```

**5. Basic Sound Analytics (40 minutes)**
- Filtering: Removing noise or specific frequencies.
- Feature extraction: MFCCs, chroma, and spectral contrast.
- Basic sound classification or sound event detection.

**6. Advanced Sound Analytics (20 minutes)**
- Introduction to machine learning with sound.
- Using pre-trained models or datasets for sound recognition.
- Real-time sound analytics: e.g., identifying specific sounds or words in a live audio stream.

**Homework/Extended Activities:**
1. Build a voice-activated command system.
2. Create a basic sound classifier using a dataset of various sounds.
3. Experiment with sound effects: reverb, echo, and pitch alteration.

---

**Resources:**
1. Raspberry Pi official documentation.
2. Python sound processing library documentation (e.g., `librosa`, `soundfile`).
3. Online communities and forums related to Raspberry Pi and sound analytics.
